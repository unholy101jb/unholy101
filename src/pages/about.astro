  <h1>What Is Unholy101?</h1>
  <p>
    Unholy101 is not just a brand. It's a community born to defend the values that once made democracy a global beacon: respect, tolerance, dignity, and pluralism.

  <p>
    In a world where hate has become a political weapon, we reclaim the power of love, rebellion, and individuality. We speak through original phrases that don’t hurt anyone — they protect everyone.

  <p>
    We are queer, we are woke, and we are proud. Our voice is loud, but our message is simple: the future belongs to those who dare to be themselves.

    <h1>The UNHOLY Manifesto</h1>

    <p><strong>We were never meant to fit in.</strong> Not in their churches, not in their laws, not in their binary cages.</p>

    <p><strong>We are the heretics</strong> of obedience, the daughters of doubt, the sons of softness, the children of joy.</p>

    <p>They told us freedom was a gift — but only for the blessed. We say: <strong>no blessing needed</strong>.</p>

    <p>We reclaim what was demonized: the queer, the foreign, the broken, the loud, the silent, the tender, the unbent.</p>

    <p><strong>UNHOLY101</strong> is not a brand. It’s a school of rebellion. A celebration of dignity. A home for those cast out.</p>

    <p>We wear our resistance. We love out loud. We fight for the right to be unblessed and free.</p>

    <p><strong>Freedom. Dignity. And the pursuit of happiness.</strong></p>
